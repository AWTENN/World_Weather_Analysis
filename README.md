##Challenge Summary and Results

First, I wanted to find destinations that were between a min and max temperature of 55 to 75 degrees, and I found over 700 results inside of that range. Then, I wanted to travel from around my state of Tennessee out west because I have never been west of the Mississippi River. So, I chose Morehead, KY as the start and end point with stops at Espanola, NM, San Quintin, Mexico, and Redmond, Washington. I was able to create a markers map of these four locations, but hard as I may try, I was unable to create a directions layer map via VS Code.
